### **Download and Preprocess the Dataset**  
To use SurakshaAI, you'll need to download and preprocess the dataset for training and testing. Follow these steps:  

1. **Download the Dataset**  
   - Download the UCF-Crime dataset from the official link:  
     [UCF-Crime Dataset Download](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/odins0n/ucf-crime-dataset).  
   - Once downloaded, move the dataset file to the `datasets/` directory:  
     ```bash
     mkdir datasets
     mv <path-to-downloaded-dataset> datasets/
     ```  

2. **Run the Preprocessing Script**  
   - To prepare the data for training and testing, run the `preprocess.py` script. This script processes the raw dataset and saves it in a format suitable for the model.  
     ```bash
     python preprocess.py
     ```  

3. **Store Processed Data**  
   - The processed data will be automatically saved in the `datasets/processed/` directory. Ensure the preprocessing completes successfully before proceeding.
  
## **Usage**  
Once you have completed the dataset download and preprocessing, you can proceed with training the model.
